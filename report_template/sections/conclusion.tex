\section{Conclusion}

This experiment used a custom UDP probe to analyze the emulated network path. The RTT shows a bimodal pattern with stable baseline latency around 30 ms and occasional spikes above 290 ms. Packet loss reached 11.7\%, occurring fairly consistently throughout the run. The measured throughput of about 457 bps reflects the application's fixed rate, but the delays and losses show that the 20 Mbps link is often saturated by cross-traffic.
