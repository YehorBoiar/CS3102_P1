\section{Introduction}

This report details the design, implementation, and analysis of a custom UDP probe application. The primary objective of this practical is to measure and analyze the end-to-end delay, packet loss, and data rate of a network link under specific emulated constraints.
\\\\
The experiment was conducted using two separate School of Computer Science Linux lab machines. The probe sender was executed on host \textbf{pc3-005-l}, which transmitted UDP packets to the \texttt{slurpe-5} reflector program that was running with \textbf{fullpe} and \textbf{rx} flags on host \textbf{pc3-006-l}. 1200 probes were sent to adhere to the requirements.
